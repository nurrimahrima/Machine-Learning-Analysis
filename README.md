# Marketing Analytics
This is a Marketing Analytics method by Machine Learning.
There are three method used, that is:
  1. Market Basket Analysis
  2. Recommendation System
  3. A/B Testing Analysis

Here it is the explanation:

**1. Market Basket Analysis (MBA)**

Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique used by retailers to increase sales by better understanding customer purchasing patterns. It involves analyzing large data sets, such as purchase history, to reveal product groupings, as well as products that are likely to be purchased together.

In Market Basket Analysis, association rules are used to predict the likelihood of products being purchased together. Association rules count the frequency of items that occur together, seeking to find associations that occur far more often than expected. Algorithms that use association rules such as AIS, SETM and Apriori. 

Here we will discuss the implementation of **Apriori Algorithm** in Market Basket Analysis.

**2. Recommendation System**

Recommendation system is a simple algorithm whose aim is to provide the most relevant information to a user by discovering patterns in a dataset. The algorithm rates the items and shows the user the items that they would rate highly. For example recommendation when you visit Amazon and you notice that some items are being recommended to you or when Netflix recommends certain movies to you. They are also used by Music streaming applications such as Spotify and Deezer to recommend music that you might like.

The most common types of recommendation systems are Content-Based (CB) and Collaborative Filtering (CF). In collaborative filtering the behavior of a group of users is used to make recommendations to other users. Recommendation is based on the preference of other users. A simple example would be recommending a movie to a user based on the fact that their friend liked the movie. Content based systems use meta data such as genre, producer, actor, musician to recommend items say movies or music. Such a recommendation would be for instance recommending Infinity War that featured Vin Disiel because someone watched and liked The Fate of the Furious.

Here we will discuss the implementation of **Content-Based (CB)** and **Collaborative Filtering (CF)** learning method and the combination of both of them, which is **Hybrid Filtering**.

**3. A/B Testing**

A/B Testing is a tried-and-true method commonly performed using a traditional statistical inference approach grounded in a hypothesis test (e.g. t-test, z-score, chi-squared test). In plain English, 2 tests are run in parallel:
- Treatment Group (Group A) - This group is exposed to the new web page, popup form, etc.
- Control Group (Group B) - This group experiences no change from the current setup.
The goal of the A/B is then to compare the conversion rates of the two groups using statistical inference.

A/B Testing enables us to determine whether changes in landing pages, popup forms, article titles, and other digital marketing decisions improve conversion rates and ultimately customer purchasing behavior. A successful A/B Testing strategy can lead to massive gains, more satisfied users, more engagement, and more sales.

Here we will discuss the implementation of **A/B Testing** on E-Commerce website.
